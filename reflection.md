# Reflection

Designing this project was harder than I expected. This project forced me to connect a lot of different topics we covered across the semester into one coherent solution. During the semester, our assignments were mostly straight forwards where we had to use Blob for this or use Functions for that problem but when I thought about how wearable data would realistically move from a patient’s device, through a vendor, into Azure, and eventually to both patients and clinicians, it quickly became complex. That beginning-to-end thinking took time. I did feel most comfortable choosing and using **Azure Blob Storage** and **Azure SQL Database**, since those matched directly with our storage and database modules. I also felt reasonably okay with using **Azure Functions** for the trend detection logic, even though in previous labs I found setting up serverless in Azure more confusing compared to Google Cloud Platform. Our HHA507 Group Assignment Part4 Flagging helped me feel more comfortable setting alerts and flagging. 

I felt decently comfortable with **Flask** with GCP so that comfort translated over to Azure as well. Using a Flask API running in Azure Container Apps for ingestion felt like a natural choice, especially since the extra-credit option mentions a Flask prototype. At the same time, there were parts of the design where I was less sure. For example, I was not entirely confident about how a real **wearable vendor REST API or webhook** would be implemented or authenticated. In this assignment, I just assume the vendor can post JSON to my `/ingest` endpoint, but I know in reality there would be more steps around security and onboarding. The data would need to comply with HIPAA and other health codes I might not be familiar with. I was also unsure how to configure **notifications in Azure** (Logic Apps or Notification Hubs)through email, SMS or mobile app. I have no direct experience with **EHR systems or FHIR**, so the EHR integration layer is conceptual rather than something I could actually build today.

One alternative architecture I seriously considered was a **pure serverless design** without Flask or containers. In that approach, the wearable vendor would call an HTTP-triggered Azure Function directly, and that function would handle validation, writing to Blob Storage, and possibly even simple baseline logic. Trend detection and alerts would still run in scheduled Functions. This design would have been simpler, cheaper, because there would be no containerized Flask app to manage. However, I decided not to choose it because I wanted to practice working with **Flask and containers** from Module 10 and test my ability to make a Flask-based prototype. 

If I had 8 more weeks and unlimited credits, I would focus on turning this design into a more complete end-to-end experience for both patients and clinicians. First, I would work on building a simple mobile or web app that can connect directly to a wearable device and stream SpO2 and heart rate readings into my cloud pipeline. I would also invest the time to tuning and validating the alert thresholds, so they feel truly personalized and clinically meaningful, to eventually minimize false alarms. The goal would be to reach a point where the systems generate alerts that patient and clinicians would actually trust and used to improve preventative care. Overall, this project gave me a better appreciation for how many moving parts are involved in cloud-based healthcare solutions and where I still need to build more experience.
